## Story-Line based Blackjack

A console-based Blackjack game in Java with a twist! Players can choose between two characters:
Kai – the noble samurai, plays with honor
EvilKai – a shadowy character with risky steal powers
The game combines classic Blackjack rules with:
Multi-round battles using HP (health points)
Story-driven character interactions
Risk vs reward mechanics for EvilKai
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, game logic, and ASCII art for console visuals.
